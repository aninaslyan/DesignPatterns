# Design Patterns

Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint that you can customize to solve a particular design problem in your code.

- **Creational** - provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
  - Singleton
  - Factory Method
  - Builder
  - Abstract Factory
  - Prototype


- **Structural** - explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping the structures flexible and efficient.
  - Decorator
  - Adapter
  - Facade
  - Composite
  - Proxy
  - Bridge
  - Flyweight


- **Behavioral** - take care of effective communication between objects and make the design more flexible and reusable.
  - Observer
  - Strategy
  - Iterator
  - Command
  - Chain of Responsibility
  - State
  - Mediator
  - Memento
  - Template Method
  - Visitor

For executing **TypeScript** codes compile the code by running `npm run compile` in terminal. Corresponding dist folder will appear according to tsconfig.json configuration which will contain .js files which were compiled from .ts files. These javascript files can be used by the browser.  
Execute `npm run serve` to start the server. Open the destination path into browser to see the results.
