For running **TypeScript** codes type `tsc` in terminal. You need to have TypeScript installed globally. Corresponding dist folder will appear according to tsconfig.json configuration which will contain all compiled .ts files. These javascript files can be used by the browser. Open the destination path into browser to see the results.
For running directories which contain multiple .ts files, webpack configuration will be needed.
